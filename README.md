AsterAvoid
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexlafroscia/asteravoid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexlafroscia/asteravoid)

A simple game using [Three.js](http://threejs.org/).  Move your ship to avoid the asteroids and try to last as long as you can.

To make it interesting, I've included support for the following types of controllers

- WASD Keys
- Arrow Keys
- Gryoscope (for mobile devices, and strangely enough, MacBooks)
- [Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) (which is why I actually started the project in the first place)


Development
-----------

1. Pull the repo
2. `npm install` (note: you need the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) gem installed)
3. `grunt`

Now you've got a server running locally on port `8000`.  Have fun!
