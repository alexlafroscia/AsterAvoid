Thanks to the wonderful [Steve Klabnik](https://github.com/steveklabnik), who detailed the steps to deploy a project like this to Github Pages using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), that's it.  Travis automatically pulls the project, builds it, and then pushes the built project over to the `gh-pages` branch.  You can find his instructions [here](https://github.com/steveklabnik/automatically_update_github_pages_with_travis_example).
